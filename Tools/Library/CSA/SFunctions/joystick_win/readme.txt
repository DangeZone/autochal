This files in this ZIP file were created by Dan Salluce to read in the input of a joystick into Simulink.

The code is to only be used on a windows 2000/XP platform with any joystick plugged in (USB or Gameport).

The code uses the common MS game device interface and is independent of calibration and detection.
This must all be completed from the Control Panel in Windows. Any device shown there should work with this
code.

There is a simulink model, the required .DLL file for the S-funtion block, and the source code provided here.
